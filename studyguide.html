            <h3> What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
                    <li>Standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
                    <li>Describes the structure of a Web page</li>
                    <li>Consists of a series of elements</li>
                    <li>elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
                    <li>elements labels pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <p>
            First, to create an HTML file, we need to put (!DOCTYPE html). Make sure to remember to open and close the tag as well. This will let the computer know that we are creating a html web. 
        </p>
        <p> Note: 
            <br>1. h1-h6 are header sizes, there are 6 max. We can make subheadings as well. 
            <br>2. br tag is used for line separation

            <h3>BOLD</h3>
            <p>
                To BOLD a text we use the <STRONG>strong tag</STRONG>.
                <br>
                <img src="img/bold tag.png" alt="Bold tag">
                <br>
                <strong>Example, we would put the phrase/word that we want to bold inside the tag. The server will automatically close the tag for us. Always Remember to put "<" first</strong>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>ITALICS</h3>
            <p>To ITALICIZE a word, we use the <em></em>
                <br>
                <img src="img/italicize tag.png" alt="italicize tag">
                <br>
                <em>Again, put the phrase/word we want to italicize inside the tag. Like the bold tag, this tag will also automatically close</em>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>USING BOTH</h3>
            <p>
                We can do both at the same time as well. To <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em> a word/phrase, make sure to put BOTH tags in and put the text in the middle of both tags. 
                <br>
                <img src="img/bold:italicize together tag.png" alt="bold/italicize">
                <br>
                <p><strong><em>1. It does not matter which order to make the tag, as long as both tags are there and the text is in the middle, the computer will know. Again, both of these tags will close automatically</em></strong>
                <br>2.If we are using both tags at the same time, only the first spacing after the open tag counts. We can place space before a new tag or space in tag for a new word.
                <br>
                For Example: <strong><em>Using together</em></strong>
            </p>

        <section>
            <h4>SHORTCUT FOR BOTH TAGS</h4>
            <p>
                We can also use <b>b tag</b> and <i>i tag</i> to bold and italicize. This is a shorter version, but try not to use them. 
                <br>
                For example, <b> This is the b tag </b> to bold
                <br>
                This is the <i>i tag</i> to italicize.
            </p>

            <h3>LINKS</h3>
            <p>
                An anchor tag is used for ataching links. However, an anchor tag by itself won't do anything; it needs to have a hypertext reference.
                <br>
                <strong>Tag:</strong> (a href=). The ref= is the hypertext reference. To write the tag, it should be (open tag) <strong>a href= "(paste the link here)"> (name the link) close tag.</strong>  
                <br>
                <img src="img/link tag.png" alt="link tag">
                For example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi5H7UwZrGg&t=53s&ab_channel=KhaZ%C3%A9"> 8D Lofi Music</a>
            </p>

            <h3>IMAGES</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Tag:</strong> img src=(insert img link or file here). Also needs <strong>"alt"</strong> at the end to describe the img. VERY IMMPORTANT when inserting img. 
                <br>
                For example: <img src="img/image tag.png" alt="img tag">
            </p>

            <h3>LISTS</h3>
            <p>
                NOTE:<em> ol tag</em> is used for order list
                <br>
                <img src="img/order list.png" alt="order list">
                <ol>
                    <li>Turn on the stove</li>
                    <li>Put pan on the stove</li>
                    <li>Cook the food</li>
                </ol>        
                Note: <em> ul tag</em> is used for unorder list
                <br>
                <img src="img/unorder list.png" alt="unorder list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Bananas</li>
                    <li>Oil</li>

            <h3>FORMS</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>input element</strong> (or tag) specifies an input field where the user can enter data. Input element can be displayed in serveral ways, depending on the type of <strong>attributes,</strong> which provide additional information about elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. For example: <em>name="value"</em>. 
                <br>
                Always specify which input type we want to create, for example:
                <ul>
                    <li> input type="button"</li>
                    <li> input type="checkbox"</li>
                    <li> input type="file"</li>
                    <li>input type= "password"</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Tips:</strong> Always use the label tag to define labels for:
                <ul>
                    <li>input type="text"</li>
                    <li>input type="checkbox"</li>
                    <li>input type="radio"</li>
                    <li>input type="file"</li>
                    <li>input="password"</li>
                </ul>
                Refer to these links for the different input elements and attributes:

            <h3> DIVS</h3>
            <div class="top-section">
            This is an example of a div. It's used for block-level organization and styling of a page element. It acts like a box. Divs grows to fit the content that is inside of it. Mostly for boxes of content. If we put a div tag within a paragraph, it forces a new line of text. This is called a block-element. This means that they stack on top of each other. 
            </div>

            <h3>SPAN</h3>
            <span>
            This is a span text.
            </span> 
            It allows us to select different lines of text within a paragraph. Span element isused for inline organization and styling.

            <h3>CSS BOX MODEL</h3>
            <div class="box">
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content.Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
            </div>

            <h3>BACKGROUND IMAGES</h3>
            <div class="text">
                The background-image property sets one or more background images for an element. By default, a background-image is palced at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.
                <br><strong>TIPS:</strong>The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but NOT the margin). ALWAYS set a background-color to be used if the image is unavailable.

            <h3>STYLING TEXT</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals">Styling Text</a>
            <h4 class="style">Font stacks default spacing, and more</h4>
            <p class="style">
                The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Font styles:</strong> Properties that affect a text's font, e.g which font gets applied, its size, and whether it's bold, italic, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Text layout styles:</strong> Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and how the text is aligned within the content box. </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Font stacking</strong> is when we tell the computer to use the font in which the server allows. For example, the popular font Futura on Mac can't be found on PCs, but if we put in Futura and San-serif, the computer will use whichever font is available for the device we are using atm.

            <h3>STYLING LINKS</h3>
            <h4 class="style">An Introduction to Pseudo Classes</h4>
            <p>
                When styling links, it's important to understand how to make use of pseudo-classes to style their states effectively. It's also important to know how to style links for use in common interface features whose content varies, such as navigation menus and tabs. Refer to this link:
